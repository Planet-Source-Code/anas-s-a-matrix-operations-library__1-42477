### Description

Matrix Operations Library

About a year ago, I was working on a project. The project required many matrix operations, that time I really wished that I would find a class or a library with ready functions for matrix manipulations (like addition, inverse, multiplication, etc…) to use in Visual Basic. Unfortunately I could not find such a class, so I decided to write my own class, I called it "cMathLib" . This class gives the user the flexibility to work with matrices and do operations on them. The dimensions of the matrices are neither pre-specified nor limited. The code is highly optimized for fast operation. The code attached contains the class file called with a demonstration on how to use it.

Opperations included in the class are :

Add, Subtract, Determinant, Inverse, Transpose, Multiply, atan2, arc cos, arc sin, PI, Print, MultiplyVectors,Magnitude of a Vector, scalar multiply, and scalar divide.

I really hope this class would be of any help to any of you who needs to work with matrix operations.
